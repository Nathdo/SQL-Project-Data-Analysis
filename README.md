# SQL-Project-Data-Analysis

I have recently completed a project in SQL where I analyzed data from Netflix. The project provided me with a dataset of Netflix content. 

Using various SQL functions and commands, I was able to extract  information from the dataset. For example, I was able to identify the most popular genres of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, the number of titles available in different countries, and the release year of the most popular titles.

This project also allowed me to hone my SQL skills and deepen my understanding of data manipulation and analysis.
